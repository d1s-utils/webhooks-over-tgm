### Webhooks over Telegram (WoT)

> âš  **This project is currently being migrated over the new stack. The main branch is completely unstable and which builds are, probably, even not working.**

WoT aims to provide a simple API for registering webhooks and sending messages to Telegram chats via them
using a single secret URL.
Just like in Discord or Slack. You simply `POST` a message to chats:

```http
POST https://wot.example.com/<nonce>
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: auth token

{
  "content": {
    "sources": [
      {
        "type": "REGULAR",
        "value": "Hello, world!",
        "subsources": []
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Features

- Easy-to-use RESTful API
- Simple [authorization](#Authorization)
- Simple subscribing and unsubscribing process
- Multiple webhooks support
- Formatting support
- Attachments support ***(WIP)***
- [Kotlin library for WoT](./wot-client)
- Spring Boot starter that autoconfigures the Kotlin library for WoT
- Automatic payload mapping from other services ***(WIP)***

### Running

To run the server you should have Java 17+ and Docker Compose installed.

Build the image:

```shell
./gradlew wot-server:bootBuildImage
```

Edit the `docker-compose.yml` file and configure the secret key used for authorization:

```yaml
# ./wot-server/docker/docker-compose.yml
# ...
services:
  # ...
  wot-server:
    # ...
    environment:
      # ...
      SIMPLE_SECURITY_AUTHENTICATION_SECRET: my_secret_key
      # ...
    # ...
  # ...
# ...
```

Run the containers:

```shell
docker-compose -f ./wot-server/docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

### Usage

Let's start with creating a webhook:

```http request
POST https://localhost:9696/api/webhooks
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: ...

{
  "name": "my-webhook",
  "botToken": "your bot token",
  "private": true,
  "targets": []
}
```

Now open the Telegram bot with which the webhook is bound and send `/subscribe`.

Since this webhook is marked as `private`, we have to send its nonce which we got in the response.

Well, let's send a message now:

```http request
POST https://localhost:9696/<webhook nonce>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "content": {
    "sources": [
      {
        "type": "REGULAR",
        "value": "Hello, world!",
        "subsources": []
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Authorization

Each request to `/api/**` path must include a secret key within the `Authorization` header.
See [Running](#Running) for more info.
